React Native DO is a starter kit for React Native and NativeBase.
You can use them as turn key solutions for your next project.
The visual design can easily be customized and all aspects of the app are implemented: from navigation to state management.
Statically typed, based on the latest React Native components, and with no native dependencies, this is the highest quality codebase you can get.
